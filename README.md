VERY basic, Simple, yet effective. It definitely doesn't have all the features you'd likely want in it(YET) however for StarwarsRP servers who have been having numerous issues with other popular weapon bases having dumb issues this could be a bit of relief to those headaches.

HOW TO USE:
(STEPS 1-3 ARE IMPORTANT AS THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD BE DELIVERING CONTENT TO YOUR SERVER. AVOID OVER USING WORKSHOP COLLECTIONS, IT JUST SLOWS DOWN SERVER REBOOTS WHEN IT HAS TO CHECK 100 DIFFERENT ADDONS FOR UPDATES THAT RARELY HAPPEN.)

STEP 1: Download the latest release in the releases tab.

STEP 2: Go to the weapons you used before and extract the content from them and upload it to your servers addon folder as well. DO NOT COPY OVER THE LUA FILES TO THE SERVER! This addon is meant for NEW weapons, the old weapons will just be rendered broken.

STEP 3: Place the addons workshop ID inside the the vaas_weapon_base/shared.lua file in the section labeled for content download.

STEP 4: Open up the base file and look at the configuration section for what you need.
STEP 5: Copy ONLY  the config section into each new swep you create.
STEP 6: Restart server, join server, test weapons and tune the configurations for them to your liking.
STEP 7: Have fun!

Feature List:
------------------------------------------------------
  1. Weapon Safety
  2. Stupid Easy SWEP Creation
  3. Extremly Light Weight compared to other weapon bases
  4. No unneeded bloat code
  5. RP Servers in mind during creation(however it will work generally on ANY and ALL servers)
  6. No gamemode restrictions as far as we know at the current moment
  7. Some anti-minge features to prevent annoying tendencies that minges do.
  8. Interchangable color confige for blasters!(red, blue, green, yellow, orange, cyan and purple)
  9. Scorch marks on impact
  10. More to come soon!
------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: It is highly advised to not use other weapon bases along side this weapon base. This one for the most part is much cleaner and easier to work with(its literally just a few simple lua files rather then an entire gamemode worth of lua)
